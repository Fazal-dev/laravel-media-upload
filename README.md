## File Handling and Security

-   Files are validated for type and size before upload.
-   Uploaded files are stored securely and uniquely named to avoid conflicts.
-   The system uses Laravel's storage functionality to manage file access.

## Troubleshooting

-   Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with Mailtrap details.
-   Check file permissions for the storage directory.
-   Review the Laravel logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`) for any errors.
